# Learning Typescript with Tic-Tac-Toe

#### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with the basic syntax of Javascript / Typescript -- Primitive types & objects, for loops, if statements, functions, etc.

This repository contains:
- A starter project, meant to be the foundation for what you the student will build.
- An accompanying Markdown document `configuration.md` which explains each of the files and folders present within the starter project. I assume no knowledge of standard project configuration, build tools, or Javascript ecosystem.
- A markdown document containing descriptions of the features that must be built for the application.
  Each of these features will be described using detail that may be unfamiliar to you--The terminology used is intentionally chosen to introduce you to important concepts that it is good for new developers to learn.
